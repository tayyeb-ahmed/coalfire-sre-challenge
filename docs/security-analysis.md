# Security Analysis

## Current Security Posture

This doc analyzes the security posture of the deployed infrastructure and identifies areas for improvement.

## Security Strengths

### Network Security
**Private App Subnets**: App instances are deployed in private subnets w/ no direct internet access
**Network Segmentation**: 3-tier architecture w/ proper subnet isolation
**Security Groups**: Layered security w/ restrictive inbound rules
**Network ACLs**: Additional stateless security layer for defense in depth
**NAT Gateway**: Controlled outbound internet access for private instances

### Access Control
**Bastion Host**: SSH access to app instances only through mgmt instance
**Restricted SSH**: Mgmt instance SSH access limited to specific IP/CIDR
**IAM Roles**: EC2 instances use IAM roles instead of access keys
**Least Privilege**: Security groups follow principle of least privilege

### Data Protection
**S3 Encryption**: ALB logs bucket encrypted at rest
**S3 Public Access Block**: Prevents accidental public exposure
**VPC Isolation**: All resources contained within VPC boundaries

## Security Gaps and Risks

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Unencrypted HTTP Traffic
- **Risk**: Data in transit not encrypted
- **Impact**: Potential eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Recommendation**: Implement SSL/TLS certificates and HTTPS

#### 2. Overly Permissive Outbound Rules
- **Risk**: App instances have unrestricted outbound internet access
- **Impact**: Potential data exfiltration, malware communication
- **Recommendation**: Restrict outbound rules to specific ports/destinations

#### 3. No Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- **Risk**: App vulnerable to common web attacks
- **Impact**: SQL injection, XSS, DDoS attacks
- **Recommendation**: Deploy AWS WAF w/ ALB

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Missing VPC Flow Logs
- **Risk**: Limited network traffic visibility
- **Impact**: Difficult to detect and investigate security incidents
- **Recommendation**: Enable VPC Flow Logs

#### 5. No CloudTrail Logging
- **Risk**: No audit trail of API calls
- **Impact**: Cannot track who did what and when
- **Recommendation**: Enable CloudTrail w/ S3 logging

#### 6. Weak Password/Key Mgmt
- **Risk**: SSH keys not centrally managed
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized access if keys compromised
- **Recommendation**: Implement AWS Systems Manager Session Manager

#### 7. No Secrets Mgmt
- **Risk**: Potential hardcoded secrets in user data
- **Impact**: Credential exposure in logs or metadata
- **Recommendation**: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store

### Low Priority Issues

#### 8. Missing Security Monitoring
- **Risk**: No real-time security alerting
- **Impact**: Delayed incident response
- **Recommendation**: Implement GuardDuty and Security Hub

#### 9. No Backup Encryption
- **Risk**: EBS snapshots not encrypted
- **Impact**: Data exposure if snapshots compromised
- **Recommendation**: Enable EBS encryption by default

#### 10. Limited Log Retention
- **Risk**: Short log retention periods
- **Impact**: Limited forensic capabilities
- **Recommendation**: Extend log retention and implement log archival

## Detailed Risk Assessment

### Network Security Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| HTTP Traffic Interception | High | High | Critical |
| Lateral Movement | Medium | High | High |
| Data Exfiltration | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Network Reconnaissance | Low | Medium | Low |

### Access Control Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| SSH Key Compromise | Medium | High | High |
| Privilege Escalation | Low | High | Medium |
| Unauthorized Access | Low | Medium | Low |

### Data Protection Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data Breach | Medium | High | High |
| Log Tampering | Low | Medium | Low |
| Backup Compromise | Low | Medium | Low |

## Compliance Considerations

### Industry Standards
- **CIS Controls**: Partially compliant, missing several critical controls
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Basic implementation, needs enhancement
- **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar**: Addresses some principles, gaps exist

### Regulatory Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data encryption and access controls partially implemented
- **SOC 2**: Logging and monitoring need enhancement
- **PCI DSS**: Not applicable for current implementation

## Security Monitoring Gaps

### Missing Monitoring Capabilities
1. **Real-time Threat Detection**: No GuardDuty or similar service
2. **Config Compliance**: No Config rules for compliance checking
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: No automated vulnerability assessments
4. **Security Metrics**: Limited security-focused CloudWatch metrics

### Recommended Monitoring Enhancements
1. Enable AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
2. Implement AWS Config for compliance monitoring
3. Set up AWS Inspector for vulnerability scanning
4. Create security-focused CloudWatch dashboards

## Incident Response Readiness

### Current Capabilities
- Basic CloudWatch logging
- S3 access logs for ALB
- Manual investigation procedures

### Missing Capabilities
- Automated incident response
- Forensic data collection
- Security playbooks
- Incident communication procedures

## Security Best Practices Implementation

### Implemented
- Network segmentation
- Least privilege access
- Infrastructure as Code
- Basic encryption at rest
- Resource tagging

### Missing
- Encryption in transit
- Centralized logging
- Automated security scanning
- Security incident response
- Regular security assessments

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
1. Implement SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
2. Restrict outbound security group rules
3. Enable VPC Flow Logs
4. Enable CloudTrail logging

### Short-term Actions (1-3 months)
1. Deploy AWS WAF
2. Implement AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
3. Enable GuardDuty
4. Set up centralized logging with CloudWatch

### Long-term Actions (3-6 months)
1. Implement comprehensive monitoring dashboard
2. Develop incident response procedures
3. Regular security assessments and penetration testing
4. Implement automated compliance checking

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### High-Impact, Low-Cost Improvements
- Enable VPC Flow Logs (~$10/month)
- Implement HTTPS w/ ACM (free)
- Restrict security group rules (no cost)

## Conclusion

The current infrastructure provides a solid foundation w/ basic security controls in place. However, several critical gaps exist that should be addressed to achieve a production-ready security posture. The most critical issues involve encryption in transit and overly permissive network access controls.

Implementing the recommended improvements will significantly enhance the security posture while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
